### General Purpose and Description of the Project
In this project I wrangled WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

##### Purpose

- gathering data from different sources
- assessing data programmatically as well as visually to spot quality and tidiness issues in a dataset
- Cleaning data using Define-Code-Test framework
- Storing data in different formats
- Conducting exploratory analysis

##### Datasets
